PART II 
What does the man command do? Type in man rm. How do you scroll and get out?
keelan@DESKTOP-CKOTPN0:~$ man rm
it lists the manual for the command, use D to go forward, B to go back a page, U to go back half a page

Look at the man page for ls. What does the -l flag do? What does the -a flag -do?
keelan@DESKTOP-CKOTPN0:~$ man ls
-l uses a long listing format with more detail
-a shows files even with a . (meaning it shows hidden files)

How do you jump between words in the terminal?
control + left/right arrows

How do you get to the end of a line in terminal?

What is the difference between a terminal and shell?

What is an absolute path?
A path that gives the complete location for a folder, starting with the root

What is an relative path?
A path that gives the location relative to the current location

What is a flag? Give three examples of flags you have used.
It gives a command extra information as to how you want it to function in that instance. We used -rf for the rm command, -r for the cp command, and looked at -a for the ls command

What do the r and f flags do with the rm command?
-f ignores nonexistent files and arguments and doesn't prompt for removal; just forcibly removes everything
-r recursively removes directories and their contents
